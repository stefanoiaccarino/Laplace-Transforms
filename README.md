# Laplace-Transforms
Here's the code, the icon for the title bar and the one for the application of a simple python-made app to do Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms. 
In release section you can find the executable too (windows only for now).
If you want to make an executable on your own I suggest you to install autopytoexe using:
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
in your Command Prompt.
I don't know if it works for Linux and MacOS too, you'd better check on Google.
Future updates may concern the Fourier transform and its inverse that seems a little bit trickier to do.
If you have any suggestion I'm here to listen up!
