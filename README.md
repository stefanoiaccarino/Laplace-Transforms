# Laplace-Transforms
Here's the code, the icon for the title bar and the one for the application of a simple python-made app to do Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms. 
In release section you can find the executable too (windows only for now).
If you want to make an executable on your own I suggest you to install autopytoexe using:
```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```
in your Command Prompt.
After installation to launch it simply open your Command Prompt and type:
```
auto-py-to-exe
```
and the app will show up. This makes doing the executable really simple.
This procedure is only for Windows. I think that doing on MacOS and Linux requires to use pyinstaller directly (autopytoexe uses pyinstaller).
To install pyinstaller use:
```
pip install pyinstaller //Use sudo, if required, before pip
```
Check the proper way to make the executable for these OS on the internet.
Future updates may concern the Fourier transform and its inverse that seems a little bit trickier to do.
If you have any suggestion I'm here to listen up!
